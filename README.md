# Tracing TM
NTM Tracing project for theory of computing. This program asks the user to enter the name of a file that contains a Turing Machine. After reading it, it will ask the user for an input string and the maximum transitions it can take. If its sucessful it will output in how many transitions it was successful, otherwise it will output that it rejected. The program will continually ask the user for input until they enter exit.
